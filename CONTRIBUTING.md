### Using Standard linter
At Great Lakes, we use the StandardJS style linter.  The good news is it is super easy to install and get going.
1. `npm install -g standard`
2. Install in your VSCode (or IDE of choice) the Standard extension.  For VSCode, it is an extension by (Sam Chen)
3. For VSCode, go into your settings and set `standard.autoFixOnSave` to `true`
